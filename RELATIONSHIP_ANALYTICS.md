| **Security** | Reliability and trustworthiness | • Consistent response patterns<br>• Promise fulfillment<br>• Crisis availability |
| **Closeness** | Emotional bond and affection | • Self-disclosure levels<br>• Affective language<br>• Personal topic engagement |
| **Conflict** | Disagreements and their resolution | • Argument patterns<br>• Resolution effectiveness<br>• Relationship repair attempts |

### Friendship Network Satisfaction (FNS) Scale

The FNS focuses on overall satisfaction with one's social network:

| Component | Description | SherpaAI Indicators |
|:----------|:------------|:--------------------|
| **Closeness Satisfaction** | Contentment with emotional connection levels | • Intimacy balance<br>• Vulnerability reciprocity<br>• Emotional response patterns |
| **Socializing Satisfaction** | Satisfaction with social interaction quality and quantity | • Interaction initiation balance<br>• Engagement quality<br>• Social planning frequency |

## Measurement Methodology

<details>
<summary>How SherpaAI quantifies relationship characteristics</summary>

### Data Sources

- **Message Content**: Linguistic patterns and themes (processed locally for privacy)
- **Interaction Metadata**: Frequency, timing, and patterns (without content access)
- **Response Dynamics**: Reciprocity, timing, and engagement patterns
- **Media Sharing**: Types and frequency of shared content
- **Reaction Patterns**: Emotional responses and engagement signals
- **Group Dynamics**: Interactions within shared spaces and communities

### Privacy-Preserving Approach

All analysis occurs on-device using:

- **Local Processing**: No raw conversation data leaves your device
- **Aggregate Metrics**: Only statistical summaries are used for insights
- **Opt-In Control**: Granular permissions for what is analyzed
- **Data Sovereignty**: You maintain complete ownership of all relationship data
- **Transparent Algorithms**: Open methodology for how metrics are calculated

### Quantification Methods

- **Natural Language Processing**: Identifying emotional tone, topic areas, and linguistic patterns
- **Temporal Analysis**: Tracking changes in communication patterns over time
- **Network Modeling**: Mapping relationship structures and interaction dynamics
- **Comparative Benchmarking**: Contextualizing metrics against anonymized baselines
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring interaction sequences and their outcomes
