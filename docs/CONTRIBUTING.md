# Contributing to SherpaAI

First off, thank you for considering contributing to SherpaAI! It's people like you that make this project possible.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/sherpai/sherpai/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/sherpai/sherpai/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Check if the enhancement has already been suggested** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/sherpai/sherpai/issues).
- If it hasn't, [create a new issue](https://github.com/sherpai/sherpai/issues/new) with a clear title and description of the suggested enhancement.
- Include any relevant examples and use cases that would help others understand your suggestion.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Good First Issues](https://github.com/sherpai/sherpai/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help Wanted Issues](https://github.com/sherpai/sherpai/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines.
4. Ensure your code passes all tests.
5. Update the documentation if necessary.
