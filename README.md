## Overview

SherpaAI builds on our telegram-proxy-caching-client to create a powerful AI agent that helps users navigate the complex social landscape of the digital world. In an age where social data is often weaponized against us, SherpaAI puts that power back in your hands.

Our mission is to create a sovereign data framework where your social interactions work for you, not against you. By securely analyzing communication patterns across platforms, SherpaAI helps you maintain meaningful relationships, identify social engineering attempts, and optimize your social capital.

## Key Features

- **Social Sovereignty**: Own and control your data while gaining actionable insights
- **Anti-Social Engineering**: Real-time detection of manipulation patterns
- **Relationship Analytics**: Measure and improve friendship health metrics
- **Communication Health**: Track and improve relationship quality
- **Smart Recommendations**: Context-aware social suggestions
- **Tribal Mapping**: Understand your social circles and their interconnections

## Philosophy

In the age of AI, vast amounts of social data are being utilized against us in our hyperconnected world. We believe it's time to start utilizing that data for our benefit. The most vulnerable decision-makers (consumers) need protection from social engineering and long-term hyper-personalized attacks.

Current privacy implementations often give power to potential attackers while leaving users unable to protect themselves. SherpaAI changes this paradigm by building a personal AI that maximizes your social capabilities while providing protection.

## Technology

SherpaAI is built on a foundation of data sovereignty and privacy-first architecture:

- **Telegram Proxy Caching**: Secure, private analysis of communications
- **Sovereign Data Storage**: Your data stays with you, not on our servers
- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: Identifying both positive relationship patterns and potential manipulation
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Connect multiple communication channels for comprehensive insights

## Research

Our approach is grounded in scientific frameworks for understanding social relationships:

- **Friendship Quality Scale (FQS)**: Assessing dimensions like proximity, security, help, companionship, and conflict
- **Friendship Network Satisfaction (FNS) Scale**: Focusing on closeness and socializing aspects
- **Convoy Model of Social Relations**: Examining the influence of personal and situational characteristics on friendship trajectories
- **Multidimensional Friendship Quality Construct**: Using a formative model to assess various aspects of friendship quality

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Integration with Telegram via secure proxy
- Basic relationship analytics
- Initial anti-social engineering detection

### Phase 2: Expansion
